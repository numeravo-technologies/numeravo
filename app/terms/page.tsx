          <TermsSection title="Overview">
            By using Numeravo, you agree to these Terms of Use. Numeravo
            provides calculators, tools, and guides for general informational,
            educational, and planning purposes.
          </TermsSection>

          <TermsSection title="Calculator results are estimates">
            Numeravo calculators are designed to provide helpful estimates based
            on the inputs you enter. Results may vary based on real-world
            conditions, local pricing, measurement accuracy, materials,
            professional requirements, taxes, fees, waste, and other factors.
          </TermsSection>

          <TermsSection title="No professional advice">
            Numeravo does not provide legal, financial, engineering,
            construction, tax, medical, or other professional advice. You should
            consult a qualified professional before making decisions that depend
            on accuracy, safety, compliance, or financial risk.
          </TermsSection>

          <TermsSection title="User responsibility">
            You are responsible for verifying calculator inputs, reviewing
            results, and determining whether the information is appropriate for
            your situation. Do not rely on Numeravo as the only source for
            critical decisions.
          </TermsSection>

          <TermsSection title="Website content">
            Numeravo may publish calculator pages, guides, examples, formulas,
            explanations, and recommendations. We aim to keep information useful
            and accurate, but we do not guarantee that all content is complete,
            current, or error-free.
          </TermsSection>

          <TermsSection title="Affiliate links and advertising">
            Numeravo may include affiliate links, sponsored links, product
            recommendations, or advertisements. If you click an affiliate link
            and make a purchase, Numeravo may earn a commission at no additional
            cost to you. You are responsible for reviewing product details,
            pricing, shipping, warranties, and seller terms before purchasing.

            Numeravo may link to third-party websites. We do not control and are
            not responsible for third-party content, policies, products,

            attempt unauthorized access, copy large portions of the site for

            Numeravo is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest
            extent permitted by law, Numeravo is not liable for damages, losses,
