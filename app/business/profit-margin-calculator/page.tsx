const faqs = [
  { question: "How do you calculate profit margin?", answer: "Subtract total unit cost and applicable fees from selling price to find profit. Divide that profit by selling price and multiply by 100 to calculate profit margin percentage." },
  { question: "What is the difference between margin and markup?", answer: "Margin divides profit by selling price. Markup divides profit by cost. The percentages are different even when cost, price, and profit are identical." },
  { question: "How do I calculate a selling price from a target margin?", answer: "When there are no fees, divide cost by one minus the target margin expressed as a decimal. This calculator also adjusts for optional fixed and percentage transaction fees." },
  { question: "Can profit margin be negative?", answer: "Yes. A negative margin means the selling price is below the combined cost and included fees, producing an estimated loss." },
  { question: "What costs should I include?", answer: "Include costs directly associated with providing one unit, such as acquisition, materials, direct labor, packaging, fulfillment, or other costs relevant to your analysis. Keep your method consistent." },
  { question: "Does this calculator include payment processing or marketplace fees?", answer: "Optional fixed and percentage fees can be included. Enter the fee structure that applies to each transaction and verify the provider's current terms." },
  { question: "Is gross margin the same as net margin?", answer: "No. Gross margin generally considers revenue minus cost of goods sold. Net margin considers a broader set of operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other costs." },
  { question: "What is a good profit margin?", answer: "There is no universal target. Appropriate margins vary by industry, business model, volume, overhead, competition, customer acquisition cost, and risk." },

      <Content title="How to use the profit margin calculator"><p>Choose the calculation that matches the unknown value. Use Calculate margin when cost and price are known. Use Find selling price when cost and target margin are known. Use Find allowable cost when price and target margin are known.</p><p>Add fixed or percentage transaction fees when they apply to each sale. Quantity expands the unit estimate into revenue, cost, fees, and profit totals without changing the underlying margin percentage.</p></Content>
      <Content title="Profit margin formula"><p>Profit equals selling price minus unit cost and included fees. Profit margin equals profit divided by selling price, multiplied by 100. Because margin uses revenue as its denominator, it describes how much of each sales dollar remains after the included costs.</p></Content>
      <Content title="Profit margin versus markup"><p>Markup measures profit relative to cost, while margin measures profit relative to selling price. For example, buying an item for $50 and selling it for $100 creates a $50 profit, a 100% markup, and a 50% margin before other fees or expenses.</p></Content>
      <Content title="How to price for a target margin"><p>Pricing from a target margin requires working backward from revenue. With no fees, selling price equals cost divided by one minus the target margin. Percentage-based fees also consume part of revenue, while fixed fees increase the amount that must be recovered.</p></Content>
      <Content title="Gross margin versus net margin"><p>This tool is most useful for unit economics and gross-margin planning. A complete net-margin analysis may also include payroll, rent, software, advertising, returns, depreciation, interest, taxes, and other overhead. Include only costs appropriate to the metric you intend to compare.</p></Content>
      <Content title="How discounts affect margin"><p>A discount reduces selling price while cost may remain unchanged, so profit margin can fall quickly. Use the 10% lower price scenario as a preliminary discount test, then enter the exact discounted price for a final estimate.</p></Content>
