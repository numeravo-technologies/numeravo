  { question: "What is the break-even point?", answer: "The break-even point is the sales level where total contribution equals fixed costs, producing neither an operating profit nor an operating loss under the entered assumptions." },
  { question: "How do you calculate break-even units?", answer: "Divide fixed costs by contribution margin per unit. Contribution margin per unit equals selling price minus variable cost per unit. Round units up because a partial unit normally cannot be sold." },
  { question: "What is contribution margin?", answer: "Contribution margin is the amount remaining from each sale after variable costs. It first covers fixed costs; sales above break-even then contribute toward operating profit." },
  { question: "What is margin of safety?", answer: "Margin of safety is the amount current or forecast sales exceed break-even sales. It indicates how far volume could decline before the business reaches its modeled break-even point." },
  { question: "Can this calculate units needed for a target profit?", answer: "Yes. It adds the target profit to fixed costs and divides that total by contribution margin per unit, rounding the result up to a whole unit." },
  { question: "Which costs are fixed and which are variable?", answer: "Fixed costs generally do not change directly with short-term unit volume, while variable costs rise with each unit sold. Classification depends on the business, time period, and relevant range, so verify assumptions with current records." },

      <Content title="How to use the break-even calculator"><p>Choose one consistent planning period, such as a month, quarter, year, project, event, or production run. Enter all fixed costs attributable to that period, the average selling price per unit, and the variable cost required to produce or deliver one unit. The calculator estimates the minimum whole units and approximate revenue required to cover those modeled costs.</p><p>Add current or forecast sales to measure estimated profit and margin of safety. Add a target profit to identify the required volume. Capacity and operating days turn the result into a feasibility check: a mathematically valid target may still be unrealistic if the business cannot produce, sell, or deliver enough units.</p></Content>
      <Content title="Fixed costs versus variable costs"><p>Fixed costs generally remain stable within the chosen period and relevant operating range. Examples may include rent, salaried administrative labor, software subscriptions, insurance, and equipment leases. Variable costs typically increase with each unit, such as product cost, direct materials, piece-rate labor, packaging, transaction charges, shipping subsidies, or job-specific supplies.</p><p>Some costs are mixed or step-based rather than perfectly fixed or variable. Classify costs consistently, use averages when appropriate, and run more than one scenario when volume could change staffing, facilities, equipment, or supplier pricing.</p></Content>
      <Content title="Contribution margin, target profit, and margin of safety"><p>Contribution margin is not the same as gross margin or final net profit. It measures what remains from each sale after the entered variable cost and shows how much each unit contributes toward fixed costs and profit. Target-profit analysis adds the desired profit to fixed costs before calculating required units.</p><p>Margin of safety compares current or forecast volume with break-even volume. A larger positive margin provides more modeled room for a sales decline; a negative margin indicates that the entered sales volume remains below break-even.</p></Content>
      <Content title="Use scenario comparison before changing price"><p>A higher selling price can reduce the units required to break even, but demand may also change. Lower variable costs may improve contribution without changing customer price, but quality, fulfillment, or supplier constraints can be affected. Compare scenarios here, then validate assumptions using actual sales behavior, customer research, capacity, and current cost records.</p></Content>
