              Start by measuring the driveway length and width. Choose a gravel
              depth based on how the driveway will be used. Then calculate
              volume, convert to cubic yards, estimate tons, and multiply by the
              material price per ton.

            For a driveway that is 100 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 6 inches
            deep, the volume is 600 cubic feet. That equals about 22.22 cubic
            yards. At 1.4 tons per cubic yard, the driveway needs about 31.11
            tons before waste. If gravel costs $45 per ton, the material cost is
            about $1,400 before delivery and other project costs.

              question="How deep should a gravel driveway be?"

            <FAQItem
              question="Does gravel driveway cost include delivery?"

            <FAQItem
              question="How much does a gravel driveway cost per square foot?"
              answer="Gravel driveway cost per square foot depends on gravel depth, price per ton, delivery, site prep, spreading, and compaction. Divide the estimated total project cost by the driveway square footage to estimate cost per square foot."
