            <p>
              One roofing square equals 100 square feet of roof
              surface. Shingles are sold in bundles, and the number
              of bundles required to cover one square depends on
              the specific product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many asphalt shingle products use approximately
              three bundles per square, but premium, designer,
              laminated, specialty, and other products may use
              different package quantities or coverage. The
              coverage printed on the product packaging should
              control the calculation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Individual shingle counts are provided as a secondary
              planning result. Ordering should be based on the
              manufacturer’s stated installed coverage per bundle,
              not solely on the number of pieces inside the bundle.

            <FaqItem
